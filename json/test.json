The existing gravity wastewater pipe has suffered multiple breaks due to the earthquakes and needs to be replaced. To complete the gravity wastewater renewal we need to dig trenches ranging from 1.1-2.5 metres deep. Dewatering, using spears and extraction pumping, will be required to drop the water table in the trenches at all times. Excavation will proceed once the ground is dry, using trench shields. A new PVC (polyvinyl chloride) pipe will be installed, then laterals will be renewed and attached at the private property boundary. There may need to be some excavation done at your boundary.\r\n\r\nAfter replacement of the waste water pipe the carriageway will be reinstated and sealed, road markings will be applied if applicable.\r\n\r\nPlease note: CCTV and flushing of lines will be required prior to commencement of main works\r\n\r\nTRAFFIC MANAGEMENT: \r\nRoad closures with detours\r\nPriority \/ Give Way\r\nManual Traffic Control\r\nOne Way systems\r\nContraflows etc?\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION:\r\nFor further information please contact the Fletcher Construction Company - 0800 444 919.
